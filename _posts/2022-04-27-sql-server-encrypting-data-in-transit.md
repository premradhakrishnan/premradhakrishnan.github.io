## How to Use This Theme
Just go ahead and read up on [how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not too hard I promise!

Download this repository [here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively) and save it to any folder you want.

Open a terminal window or a command line and ```cd``` to that location.

Then enter: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```. You can now access your new Jekyll site from [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Have fun exploring your new site!
