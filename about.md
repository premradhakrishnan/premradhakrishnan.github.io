Everyone is time poor. So my aim for this blog is to always keeps things as succint as possible and hence the bullets below.

### Who am I
* Husband, dad, brother, son, friend.
* Software Engineer with 15+ years experience
* Solution Architect at SSW
* Work remotely from Coffs Harbour

### What do I do
* Fullstack dev
* Love working on data projects and scripting in Azure
* Also love solving a-m-g-r-a-n-s-a (I mean anagrams)

### Lines I like 
* "Life would be much easier if I had the source code." - Anonymous
* "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." – Linus Torvalds
* "First, solve the problem. Then write the code." - John Johnson

That's enough about me. Let's get to work!
