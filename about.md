A blog for my notes so I don't have to rely on my awful memory. Along the way I am hoping it also helps others.

### Who am I
* Husband, dad, brother, son, friend.
* Software Engineer with 15+ years experience
* Solution Architect at SSW
* Work remotely from Coffs Harbour

### What do I do
* Fullstack dev
* Love working on data projects and scripting in Azure
* Also love solving anagrams

### Favourite quotes 
* "Life would be much easier if I had the source code." - Anonymous
* "Talk is cheap. Show me the code." – Linus Torvalds
* "First, solve the problem. Then write the code." - John Johnson

That's enough about me. Let's get to work!
